# Viper

`Viper` is a memory based caching mechanism which is aimed towards `ease of use` and speed. It's in a very early stage right now and not meant to use for production environments.

## Features

You can interact with Viper through its `REPL` using commands. The commands are listed below:

-   [x] -   `implemented`

-   [x] `SET`
-   [x] `GET`
-   [x] `UPDATE`
-   [ ] `CLEAR`
-   [x] `HELP`
-   [x] `EXIT`
-   [ ] `AUTH`
-   [x] `INFO`
-   [x] `LIST`
-   [ ] `GETUSER`
-   [ ] `WHOAMI`

## Roadmap
